##Intent
This repository is an effort to maintain the commit history of KS after development from Kuali.org has stopped.  At this time there are no plans to maintain the project from the Kuali Foundation, the KualiCo organization, or from any other parties.  As there have been no decisions regarding timelines, scope, and intent with regards to supporting this codebase from KualiCo and the Kuali Foundation, we are creating this codebase as a means for other communities to support the codebase by making it publicly available.  If a community forms that wishes to maintain this codebase administration of this repository will be transferred to the new community.

## Committing Code
At this time, pull requests will remain unpushed until a community forms to govern the review, acceptance, and release policies.
How does this repository relate to svn.kuali.org?
This project is a fork of the Kuali Student SVN repo as of the nightly build tag 917 which occurred on October 12th 2014.  This tag was considered a milestone release (details below).
State of Applications at the time of forking
This code base originated from https://svn.kuali.org/repos/student/enrollment/trunk.  Application All commit history has been preserved  of Curriculum Management 3.0 (ks-lum Milestone 1 of Founder’s Release 1) and Enrollment 1.0 (ks-enroll Milestone 2 of Founder’s Release 2).  Academic Planning is in a stable but functionally incomplete state (see https:\\wiki.kuali.org for more details).

## Building and Running
Steps to build and run the code can be found here: https://wiki.kuali.org/display/STUDENTDOC/3.+Build+the+Database+and+Code
Due to limitations of GitHub file sizes we’ve moved the database files to https://github.com/kuali-student/ks-development-impex so for step 3.2 you’ll need to clone that repo for loading data.
